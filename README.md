# Redesign Assignment

Pick some organization (government agency, school, your high school alumni group...basically anything not for-profit) and give their homepage a makeover. Modify [`index.html`](index.html) (and add stylesheets, images, whatever) in this repository to give an example of how their site could present information more clearly, work well in mobile browsers, and be generally friendlier to the user.

You are strongly encouraged to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If your design skills are lacking, feel free to rip off the look of an existing site â€“ just make sure to give it credit.

## Example Sites

* [Federal Student Aid](https://studentloans.gov/)
* [US Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/)
* [US Senate](http://www.senate.gov/)
