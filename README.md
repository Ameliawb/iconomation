# Redesign Assignment

Pick some organization (government agency, school, your high school alumni group...basically anything not for-profit) and give their homepage a makeover.

* Change this README to explain the issues you identified with the existing site
* Modify [`index.html`](index.html) (and add stylesheets, images, whatever) in this repository to give an example of how their site could:
    * Present information more clearly
    * Work well in mobile browsers
    * Be generally friendlier to the user

You are strongly encouraged to use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). If your design skills are lacking, feel free to rip off the look of an existing site â€“ just make sure to give it credit.

## Example Sites

* [Federal Student Aid](https://studentloans.gov/)
* [US Department of Education](http://www.ed.gov/)
* [US Senate](http://www.senate.gov/)
