# Iconomation Assignment

Create an animation that walks the viewer through some process, using only icons/emoticons/emoji. See http://bfl-itp.github.io/iconomation/ for a demo. Even without knowing *any* JavaScript, the code in [`scripts/iconomation.js`](scripts/iconomation.js) should be enough to get you started. What's included on the page:

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [Additional "easing" functions for jQuery](http://jqueryui.com/easing/)
* [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [Emoji CSS](http://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/)

Feel free to add any images or [other icon libraries](http://weloveiconfonts.com/) you need.
